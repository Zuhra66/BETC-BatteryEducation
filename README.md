## Introduction:
This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of battery-focused and related educational programs offered by institutions across the United States. With 438 entries and 35 attributes, it captures essential details about universities, colleges, technical schools, and training providers that deliver programs in areas such as battery technology, energy systems, and advanced manufacturing. The data includes institutional characteristics (e.g., accreditation, public/private status, degree level), program details (e.g., name, length, delivery mode, prerequisites, costs, and funding avenues), and industry relevance (e.g., battery-specific offerings, STEM alignment, and prospective job opportunities).

By highlighting both academic and professional training opportunities, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, educators, and workforce development planners seeking to understand the educational landscape driving the clean energy and electric vehicle revolution.
